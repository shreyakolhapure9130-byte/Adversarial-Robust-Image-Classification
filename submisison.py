"""
Submission script for the Robustness task.
Submission Requirements (read carefully to avoid automatic rejection):
1. FILE FORMAT
----------------
- The file must be a PyTorch state dict saved as a .pt file.
- Save only the state dict, not the full model instance:
      torch.save(model.state_dict(), "model.pt")  # correct
      torch.save(model, "model.pt")               # wrong
2. MODEL ARCHITECTURE
----------------------
- You must specify the model architecture using the model-name field.
- Allowed values: resnet18, resnet34, resnet50
- The architecture must match the state dict you are submitting.
3. MODEL REQUIREMENTS
----------------------
- Input shape must be (1, 3, 32, 32)
- Output shape must be (1, 9)
- The final fc layer must be replaced to output 9 classes
4. EVALUATION
--------------
- Your model must achieve clean accuracy greater than 50% to be accepted.
- Submissions below this threshold will be automatically rejected.
- Score = 0.5 * clean accuracy + 0.5 * robustness accuracy
5. TECHNICAL LIMITS
--------------------
- Only one submission per group every 60 minutes.
- If your submission fails due to an error on your side, the cooldown is 2 minutes.
Your submission will fail if:
- The file is not a valid .pt state dict
- The model-name does not match the submitted state dict
- The output shape is not (1, 9)
- The input shape is not (1, 3, 32, 32)
- Clean accuracy is below 50%
